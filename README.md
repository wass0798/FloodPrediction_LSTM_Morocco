Flood Prediction Using LSTM and GIS Data
Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to predict flood-prone areas using GIS raster data and sample point observations. The workflow includes data extraction, augmentation, model training, and evaluation.

The repository provides a reproducible pipeline for flood risk assessment in regions with complex hydrology, demonstrated on Tetouan and Tata in Morocco.
